            <h2>Section One: Inspiration</h2>
            <p>This website is inspired by 2 questions that have been frequently asked every day:</p>
            <p>1. What do we eat today?</p>
            <p>2. What food do I buy today?</p>
            <p>Also, everyone has had some of these experiences below:</p>
            <p>1. You search for different recipes to cook for a meal but can’t decide which one, because they all look tasty.</p>
            <p>2. When you are cooking pasta, you find out there’s no basil in your fridge.</p>
            <p>3. You come back from shopping in Tesco, later you find out you forget to buy milk. So you have to go back and buy it.</p>
            <p>……</p>
            <p>We are trying to solve all of these problems in our website – “Lots of Dishes”. We believe that although technology provides massive information everyday which makes choices harder to make, it can possibly simplify things too. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">    
            <h2>Section Two: Project Concept</h2>
            <p>“Lots of Dishes” is a food manager that makes choosing what to eat everyday a game that’s exciting and playable for you.</p>
            <p>Choosing what to eat is like playing the game of drawing lots (that’s how the name of the website comes out). Imaging there are a bunch of balls in front of you with the names of dishes on, all you have to do is pick up anyone randomly. And what’s on the ball is the dish that you are going to cook for this meal. Our website uses the database to help people decide which dish to choose quickly and personalize their dishes according to their preferences.</p>
            <p>Choosing what to buy is the combination of the recipes, the calculator and the shopping list. There are always some recipes telling you that you need 1/4 lemon, or 1/2 cucumber. After deciding the dishes of the week, the system summarizes the shopping list for you without leaving out some small things like basil and green onion.</p>
            <h3>Target customers</h3>
            <p>This website is helpful for everyone. Whether you don’t have a clue of today’s dish, or you are looking for some new recipes to try in the database, or you just want to calculate the shopping list, you can get what you want on the website.</p>
            <h3>Commercial possibilities</h3>
            <p>It provides the market of food providers to offer the food delivery services once you made your shopping list. It saves people time and energy wandering in the supermarket and searching for the exact food.</p>

            <h2>Section Three: Project Development</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="container">    
            <h3>Theme Colors</h3>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <img src="images/color theme-1 .jpg">
                <p>#000000</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <img src="images/color theme-2 .jpg">
                <p>#FF9933</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container">    
            <p>Because the different dishes can be a feast for the eye, we decide to choose black and grey to be the canvas of the website, which lets the customers focus on the dishes. The orange color chosen is a color psychology to increase people’s appetite. </p>
            <h3>Structure</h3>
            <img src="images/01 framework.jpg" width=100%>
            <p>This website is layed out in a Hierarchical Structure. The three parent categories are “Meal Plan” “Recipes” and “Submission 1 Report”.</p>
            <p>The first category – “Meal Plan” carries the main function of our website, which is the game of randomly choose our daily dishes. By a click on the “start” button, the users enter the page of “Weekly Dishes”, where they can choose the dishes of the days. In the pop-up window, the users can use “spin” to generate the dishes, if the outcome isn’t satisfying, the users can “spin” again. When they click “confirm”, this dish adds to the list of “Weekly Dishes”. After choosing all of the dishes that the users want, they can enter the next page “Shopping List”. The system automatically adds up every item of the shopping list and the users can choose to print the shopping list or send it to mobile devices or even ask the supermarket to deliver, which is the commercial opportunity that can be extended.</p>
            <p>The second category --“Recipes” connects to our database. On this page the users can explore our database of recipes on their browser. When they click the dish, they will enter the description page, where they can see the picture, the ingredients and the video of how to do it. The video links to an external online source. Also, they can add their own recipes and delete the database online according to their own preferences, which is a good way to interact with the database.</p>
            <p>The third category –“Submission 1 Report” is the place where we put our report and the link of MediaHopper Create screenshot video.

            <p>3. Enable the function of uploading and deleting personal recipes online.</p>

            <h3>About tasks</h3>
            <p>In the first submission, we tend to choose the areas that we are familiar with to work on. In the second submission, there may be some opportunities for the front-end developers to divide in the back-end development and vice versa.</p>
